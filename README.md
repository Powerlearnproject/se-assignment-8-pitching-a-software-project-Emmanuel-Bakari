Critical Financial Information to Include
1.	Revenue Projections:
o	Detailed Breakdown: Projected revenue by source (e.g., subscriptions, licensing). Include assumptions about customer acquisition and retention.
o	Growth Trends: Show expected revenue growth over time, typically for 3-5 years.
Example: “We project $500,000 in revenue for the first year, growing to $2 million by year three, driven by a 10% monthly increase in subscription sales.”

5.	Break-Even Analysis:
o	Break-Even Point: The point at which total revenue equals total costs, resulting in no profit or loss. This helps in understanding how much revenue is needed to cover all expenses.
Example: “We anticipate reaching our break-even point with $1 million in revenue, which is expected to be achieved within 18 months.”
